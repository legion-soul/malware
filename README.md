# MALWARE
This was a project, I worked during the summer of 2023 since then I have added some updates to the program.

<H2>Description:</H2>
This ransomware, employed by sophisticated threat actors, systematically encrypts all files upon infiltration. It imposes a critical 48-hour timeframe, after which, absent intervention with a designated decrypter, all encrypted files face irreversible deletion. However, should the victim apply the decrypter within the stipulated timeframe, the ransomware initiates a controlled decryption process, restoring the files to their original state. Though the decryptor is present within the affected system, for the decrypter to start needs a password given by the threat actor.

<H2> Installation</H2>

**Install Depedencies using pip**
<code>pip3 install depen</code>

**Clone Repository using Git**
<code>git clone https://github.com/legionxsoul/malware/ </code>

**Run the ransomware file (legion.py)**
<code>python3 legion.py </code>

**Check if your files have been encrypted, and a timer is running opening a new terminal**

**Run the decrypter usinf the password: legionxsoul**
<code>python3 .xsoul.py</code> 

**You can see that the files have been decrypted and the malware have been deleted**

<h2> Demonstration</h2>
Here is the demonstration of the malware.
We have 3 files, existing within the system (username.txt, password.txt, pin.txt).
Once the malware (legion.py) is runned in the system, it reconnaissances for the files and encryptes them giving the user 48 hours to run the decrypter file.
Reading the files, we see all the files are encrypted.
A timer spawns up on the terminal running the timer, post opening a new session and running the decryptor we could see that the files were decrypted.
