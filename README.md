This was a project, I worked during the summer of 2023 since then I have added some updates to the program.

**Description:**
This ransomware, employed by sophisticated threat actors, systematically encrypts all files upon infiltration. It imposes a critical 48-hour timeframe, after which, absent intervention with a designated decrypter, all encrypted files face irreversible deletion. However, should the victim apply the decrypter within the stipulated timeframe, the ransomware initiates a controlled decryption process, restoring the files to their original state. Though the decryptor is present within the affected system, for the decrypter to start needs a password given by the threat actor.
